This dataset regroups 15 male C57BL/6 mice, which were scanned for 13min under different anesthesia protocols: isoflurane, dexmedetomidine, or the combination of the two. Hypercapnia was induced between t=5min and t=8min. Data was acquired with a 7T Bruker scanner at the Cerebral Imaging Center (CIC) of the Douglas Research Center, Montreal, Canada.
